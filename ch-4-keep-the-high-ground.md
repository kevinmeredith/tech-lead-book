# Ch 4. Keep the High Ground

In one of Jocko Willink's podcast, he discusses the concept of "high ground" from "About Face: The Odyssey of an American
Warrior" by David Hackworth.

It's a critical concept for leadership and human development. To me it means taking the path of fairness and truth. The
"high ground" is unassailable. "High ground" is what professionals take. Anything else is for the "amateur," as Steven
Pressfield (`*`) might say. The "high ground" is true leadership.

Consider the following exchange I had with one of my teammates. In this example, Phil and I work on Team Alpha. Phil
had opened a pull request against one of Team Bravo's repositories. He encountered resistance from Team Bravo that
made Phil bristle.

> Me:   Hey Phil. I know you were having some problems with Team Bravo on your pull request. How's it going? <br/>
> Phil: It's rough. The quality of their code-base is low. They made completely unreasonable comments on my  <br/>
>       pull request. It's making me upset and I don't even want to bother to respond. <br/>
> Me:   I'm sorry to hear that. Can you give me an example? <br/>
> Phil: They told me to use the existing library that's used throughout the whole code-base. But this open-source library <br/>
        hasn't been updated in 2 years. I introduced new library that's been downloaded a million times a week and it's <br/>
        used by big, mature tech companies. <br/>
> Me:   I can see how that would be frustrating. How did you respond to that comment? <br/>
> Phil: Oh - I haven't responded yet and don't intend to. It's a waste of my time to respond to those people. <br/>
> Me:   What do you think about responding professionally to their comments? <br/>
> Phil: Really? <br/>
> Me:   Let's look at a few ways to respond to the PR comment and the various outcomes. <br/>
>       (1) Answer professionally on why you made that choice. Include your rationale in a straightforward, respectful <br/>
>           way. Mention that you care about the quality of the code-base. Choosing a battle-tested library supports <br/>
>           the business by standing on the shoulders of a highly tested library. <br/>
>       (2) Dismiss or ignore their comments <br/>
>
>       How do you think the comment's author would respond in each case? In the first, the best case is that you <br/>
>       become engaged in a thought-provoking, data-driven debate. In the second response, it's most likely going to <br/>
>       ultimately extend the amount of time required before merging it. Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, your <br/>
>       relationship with this person, as well as Team Bravo, will suffer. <br/>
>
>       Since our team's road-map requires building more changes this code-base, it's our team's (and the company's) <br/>
>       interest that our team has a good relationship with Bravo. Otherwise, code reviews will drag on, mean and bitter <br/>
>       comments will dominate, and the team will ultimately miss its deadline. <br/>
>
> Phil: If I respond professionally to their comments, I doubt that Team Bravo will engage me seriously in a fair <br/>
>       "data-driven" debate. On one of my code changes, their teammate, Bob, had commented, "Why did you do this? <br/>
>       (thumbs down emoji)" How am I supposed to respond to someone so rude? <br/>
> Me:   I agree with you that such a comment is unprofessional and unhelpful. But, if we respond professionally to <br/>
>       try to extract a meaningful question from Bob's comment, we keep the high ground. <br/>
> Phil: Bob's just going to respond with another inane comment to my professional response. <br/>
> Me:   If one of Team Bravo's teammates respond disrespectfully to your honest question, the high ground protects us. <br/>
> Phil: I don't understand. <br/>
> Me:   Let's say Bob continues to respond rudely to your honest, professional responses - and thus blocking your progress. <br/>
>       At a certain point, we'll need to escalate this blocker up the chain of command. Whom will Management find <br/>
>       at fault for your stalled Pull Request: Team Alpha, whose code author, you, responds calmly and professionally, <br/>
>       or Team Bravo, whose engineer is acting unprofessionally and rudely? <br/>
> Phil: Yeah - I see your point. Let me keep the high ground. <br/>
> Me:   Thanks, Phil. Let me know if I can help at all. To say more, the purpose of the High Ground isn't to win <br/>
>       to win arguments or escape blame. The value of the High Ground is the inherent value in maintaining it, as well <br/>
>       as its influence on others. At the end of the day, our company is going to be stronger and better if Teams Alpha <br/>
>       and Bravo work together. We're on the same team. <br/>

When I think of the High Ground, "The 48 Laws of Power"'s (`**`)  story on Talleyrand immediately comes to mind. It adds
a further dimension to the High Ground - keeping cool and thinking clearly under pressure.

Talleyrand was a close advisor to Napoleon. Napoleon learned that Talleyrand had effectively betrayed him. Napoleon,
red with rage, screamed and shouted at Talleyrand in front of his other advisors. Throughout the entire outburst, Talleyrand
maintained his calmness and composure - almost aloof to the situation.

When we encounter pressure or petty attacks, look to Talleyrand. Talleyrand saw an imminent death sentence, but kept the
High Ground. We can do it too. It will make us better, as well as our team via its magnetic influence.

`*` - Read "The War of Art" and "Turning Pro" from Mr. Pressfield on these excellent works.
** - "The 48 Laws of Power" by Robert Greene - excellent book on human nature and power.
