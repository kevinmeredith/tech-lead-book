# Introduction

## Background

My name is Kevin Meredith. I began writing software professionally in 2009. For a few years I treated software
development entirely as a job. It wasn't until I took a graduate class on the Scala programming language that I
craved to learn more and continuously improve. Once I attended the 2013 NEScala Conference at Drexel University, I fell
in love with functional programming. Since 2013, I've worked as a Software Engineer on a full-time and contract basis
across Medical Insurance, Logistics, Cruiseline, Online Banking, and Gambling industries. I wrote "A Little Book on
http4s," a book on the Scala HTTP library. I've worked as a Software Engineer, and then Technical Lead, at two
separate companies.

In late 2020 I learned about Stoicism through Ryan Holiday's podcast, "Daily Stoic". It's a practical life philosophy
that aims to make its practitioners live fuller, better lives. From Stoicism, I learned about Robert Greene's books,
namely, "The 48 Laws of Power" and "The Laws of Human Nature." Right before learning about Stoicism, I met Jocko
Willink's book, "Extreme Ownership." The aforementioned authors and their books have influenced my own life greatly.

## What is a Tech Lead?

The book, "Art of Scalability, The: Scalable Web Architecture, Processes, and Organizations for
the Modern Enterprise," defines leadership as:

> 'influencing the behavior of an organization or a person to accomplish a specific objective.'

A Technical Lead's role is to apply leadership in a technical capacity. The author, Patrick Lencioni,
perfectly describes the criticality of teamwork in the beginning of his excellent book,
"The Five Dysfunctions of a Team:"

    Not finance. Not strategy. Not technology.

    It is teamwork that remains the ultimate competitive advantage, both because
    it is to powerful and so rare.

    If you could get all the people in an organization rowing in the same direction,
    you could dominate any industry, in any market, against any competition.

In this book, I share the principles that I believe are fundamental for a Tech Lead to practice.

## Why I Wrote This Book

I decided to write this book based on my own personal experiences as a Technical Lead at
two companies. I aim to apply the principles that I've applied and learned from the aforementioned excellent
authors into this book.

I hope to contribute to the leadership development of existing and to-be Technical Leaders. Lastly, I hope to receive
feedback, critical and positive, on this book.

"Win or learn," not "Win or Lose," as Jocko has taught me!
