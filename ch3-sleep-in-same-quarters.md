# Ch 3. Sleep in the Same Quarters as the Troops

I don't recall where I had read or heard this story. It goes something like:

> During a war, soldiers were sleeping in tents outside in the elements. Their leader
> slept indoors in a building with air conditioning and a comfortable bed. When trying to rally
> the troops to boost their morale, the leader said, "I know we've had to endure the hardship of this
> camp's tough conditions." At he went on, the troops glanced at one another in disbelief. How could
> their leader relate to their conditions as he slept in a comfortable bed indoors while they, each night,
> faced Nature in tents alone?

Steven Pressfield's "X" higlights the epitome of a leader in this story of Alexander the Great:

> ... <insert story about how he poured water on the ground when his men had none>

From Ch 2, I mentioned that I had led a team of engineers on an exhausting on-call rotation. That four-man, 5-week
rotation looked like:

Primary:   Me    / Sally / Me  / Sam  / Bill
Secondary: Sally / Me    / Sam / Bill / Me

Read it as, for week 1, "Me" was the primary, and "Sally" was the secondary. Then, at the start of week 2, "Sally"
took on the primary, and "Me" was secondary.

Over the five-week rotation, I took two shifts, whereas the remaining three team members took one. I took it upon
myself to bear more of the burden as the leader. It was my duty to my fellow troops.
