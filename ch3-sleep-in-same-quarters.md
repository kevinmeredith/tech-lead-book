# Ch 3. Sleep in the Same Quarters as the Troops

I don't recall where I had read or heard this story. It goes something like:

::: {.conversation}
    During a war, soldiers were sleeping in tents outside in the elements.
     Their leader slept indoors in a building with air conditioning and
     a comfortable bed. When trying to rally the troops to boost their morale,
     the leader said, "I know we've had to endure the hardship of this
     camp's tough conditions." At he went on, the troops glanced at one
     another in disbelief. How could their leader relate to their conditions
     as he slept in a comfortable bed indoors while they, each night, faced
     Nature in tents alone?

From Ch 2, I mentioned that I had led a team of engineers on an exhausting on-call rotation. That four-man, 5-week
rotation looked like:

::: {.conversation}

    Primary:   Me    / Sally / Me  / Sam  / Bill
    Secondary: Sally / Me    / Sam / Bill / Me

:::

Read it as, for week 1, "Me" was the primary, and "Sally" was the secondary. Then, at the start of week 2, "Sally"
took on the primary, and "Me" was secondary.

Over the five-week rotation, I took two shifts, whereas the remaining three team members took one. I took it upon
myself to bear more of the burden as the leader. It was my duty to my fellow troops.

Steven Pressfield's book, "The Warrior Ethos," perfectly captures the epitome of a leader in this story of
Alexander the Great:

::: {.conversation}

    Once, Alexander was leading his army through a waterless desert. The column
     was strung out for miles, with men and horses suffering terribly rom thirst.

    Suddenly, a detachment of scouts came galloping back to the king. They
     had found a small spring and had managed to fill up a helmet with water.
     They rushed to Alexander and presented this to him. The army held in
     place, watching. Every man's eye was fixed upon his commander. Alexander
     thanked his scouts for bringing him this gift, then, without touching a drop,
     he lifted the helmet and poured the precious liquid onto the sand.

    At once, a great cheer ascended, rolling like thunder from one end of
     the column to the other. A man was heard to say, "With a king like this to lead
     us, no force on earth can stand against us."

Who could actually compete with an organization with such a leader?
