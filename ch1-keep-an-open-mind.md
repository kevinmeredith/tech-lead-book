# Ch 1. Zoom Out

In this scenario, `Tech Lead` and `Bob the Intern` work on the same team, who's responsible for developing back-end web
services. Your author is the `Tech Lead` in this example. The following conversation took place in Slack in a channel
devoted to an important feature. The Vice President of Engineering regularly posted her opinions to questions and comments.

```
Tech Lead: OK, Bob the Intern *, all of the feature's server-side changes have been deployed to User Acceptance Test (UAT)**.
Let's coordinate with iOS and Android on testing. I suggest they test the changes on their own, and then let us and the
Product Team know their results.

Bob the Intern: Come to think of it, I'm not so sure asynchronous is the right way to go. There's many tests to run and
our business work flows are complex. How about we schedule 30 minutes with iOS, Android, and Product to make sure
the end-to-end flows get sign-off from Product?

Tech Lead: I agree, Bob. You've laid out strong arguments for why we should choose synchronous over asynchronous. I'll
set up that meeting for later this afternoon. Thanks!
```

Let's examine the above conversation. I, the `Tech Lead`, had proposed an idea on how to test out a major feature. My
teammate, `Bob the Intern`, disagreed, laying out a strong argument for his idea.

My initial, fleeting, ego-driven thought to Bob's response was:

```
What does Bob know about Software Development? He's been working in the field for a few months. I've got
ten years of experience. Wiiere does Bob get the nerve?
```
Luckily, I realized this nonsense was driven by my Ego. Taking a breath, I zoomed out and looked at both options
objectively: testing synchronously or asynchronously, including pros and cons of each. Looking at them, the choice was
clear: asynchronous. Then I responded in Slack as I had above, applauding Bob's insight.asynchronous

Remember that leadership is defined as "influencing the behavior." Is it in the best interest of the company for
decisions to be made based on individuals' Egos or an objective analysis of pros/cons? Which decisions are likely to be
better: those driven entirely by Ego or ones made based on objective analyses of facts? Which decisions are likely
to produce higher revenues and profits for the company: those made due to Ego or those driven by the truth alone?

Clearly these questions require no explicit answers. As a Tech Lead, your duty is to influence the company in making
technical decisions that are the best. When evaluating multiple options, clearly and calmly evaluate their pros and cons,
and encourage technical debate with your teammates. Failing to uphold this fair assessment will result in worse choices
for the company.

In short, given the choice between winning and losing, which will you pick?

`*`  - Clearly I didn't address this person as "Bob the Intern," but the person's title helps towards demonstrating
 the spirit of this chapter.
`**` - UAT is a deployment environment that precedes Production.
