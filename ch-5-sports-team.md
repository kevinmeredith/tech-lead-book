# Ch 4. Sports Team

Performance Management consists of observing an employee's contributions and behaviors, as well as taking
actions to affirm, better understand, improve or remove the employee. This function is critical to the success
of a "Sports Team" company.

Typically a Technical Lead does not have the direct authority to grant raises or fire people. However, it is their
primary purpose to help the team to win. As a result, the Technical Lead possesses indirect authority towards Performance
Management.

In late 2022, Peloton chose a new CEO, Barry McCarthy. He noted in the New York Times (`*`):

> We’re a sports team, and we’re trying to win the Super Bowl. And so we’re going to put the best
> players on the field we can. And if you go down the field, and we throw you the ball, and you drop
> it a bunch, we’re going to cut you. Because everybody else who’s trying hard to win the game deserves
> to have the best players on the field. And if you’re a good player, you’re going to love being on
> this team.

In an organization consisting of a Manager with six to ten direct reports, spanning two separate development teams, the
Manager usually knows if someone is performing well or failing miserably. However, reaching the "failing miserably"
point takes considerable, precious time. Napoleon Bonaparte remarks:

> I may lose a battle, but never a minute.

The Technical Lead must have a closer gauge of a teammate's progress given they're more involved with the technical
details, such as code and architectures. As a result, they're poised to applaud teammates doing a great job, as well
as step in early to help teammates who are struggling.

Mr. McCarthy's earlier quote clearly explains the need for a high-performing team: to win. Another important aspect
of keeping standards high is morale. In my experience, I observed a low-performing teammate sink morale on one of my
team's top performers. Essentially a new Engineer, Joe, joined my team with the title, "Staff Software Engineer." This
person's job was to, primarily, coach other Engineers and host weekly training sessions. Management decided that
these "Staff" roles should directly contribute technically, so this person got assigned to join my team. His first task
was to pair with a high performing "Senior Software Engineer," Bob, on my team on a larger project. After one-and-half weeks,
I had my regularly scheduled 1-1 with the "Senior."

> Me: Hey Bob - how's everything going with Joe?
> Bob: Terrible. He's not opened a Pull Request or made any visible progress.
> Me: I'm sorry to hear that. Has he sought any advice from you or asked any questions?
> Bob: None. He's slowing me down since I'm dependent on his task for closing out this project. If
>      he doesn't show any progress by end of this week, I'm going to open a Pull Request for this work.
> Me: I understand, Bob. Let me talk to Joe to see if I can get to the bottom of his zero progress.
