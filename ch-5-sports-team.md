# Ch 5. Sports Team

Performance Management consists of observing an employee's contributions and behaviors, as well as taking
actions to affirm, better understand, improve or remove the employee. This function is critical to the success
of a "Sports Team" company.

In late 2022, Peloton chose a new CEO, Barry McCarthy. He provides a clear explanation of a "Sports Team" company
in the New York Times (`*`):

> We’re a sports team, and we’re trying to win the Super Bowl. And so we’re going to put the best
> players on the field we can. And if you go down the field, and we throw you the ball, and you drop
> it a bunch, we’re going to cut you. Because everybody else who’s trying hard to win the game deserves
> to have the best players on the field. And if you’re a good player, you’re going to love being on
> this team.

Typically a Technical Lead does not have the direct authority to grant raises or fire people. However, it is their
primary purpose to help the team to win. As a result, the Technical Lead possesses indirect authority towards Performance
Management.

In an organization consisting of a Manager with six to ten direct reports, spanning two separate development teams, the
Manager usually knows if someone is performing well or failing miserably. However, reaching the "failing miserably"
point takes considerable, precious time. It's the role of the Technical Lead to identity and contribute to the resolution
of performance problems promptly.

Napoleon Bonaparte remarked:

> I may lose a battle, but never a minute.

Depending on how close the Manager is to their tema, the Technical Lead must have a closer gauge of each of their
teammate's progress given they're more involved with the technical details, such as code and architectures. As a result,
they must be quick to applaud teammates doing a solid job, as well as step in early to help teammates who are struggling.
Ultimately, the Technical Lead must speak up to their Manager and/or decision-making powers if the struggling teammate
fails to improve.

Mr. McCarthy's earlier quote clearly explains the need for a high-performing team: to win. Another important aspect
of keeping standards high is morale. In my experience, I observed a low-performing teammate sink the morale of one of my
team's top performers. Essentially a new Engineer, Jason, joined my team with the title, "Staff Software Engineer." This
person's job was to, primarily, coach other Engineers and host weekly training sessions. Management decided that
these "Staff" roles should directly contribute technically, so this person got assigned to join my team. Jason's first task
was to pair with a high performing "Senior Software Engineer," Bob, on my team on a larger project. After one-and-half weeks,
I had my regularly scheduled 1-1 with Bob.

    Me:  Hey Bob - how's everything going with Jason?
    Bob: Terrible. He's not opened a Pull Request or made any
         visible progress.
    Me:  That's not good. Has he sought any advice from you or
         asked any questions?
    Bob: None. He's slowing me down since I'm dependent on his task
         for closing out this project. If he doesn't show any progress
         by end of this week, I'm going to do the work myself.
    Me:  I understand, Bob. Let me talk to Jason to see if I can get
         to the bottom of his zero progress. Let's discuss this further
         at our next 1-1.

At my next weekly 1-1 with my Manager, I raised the concern of Jason's poor performance. Unfortunately, Jason continued
to struggle and not deliver results. At my next few 1-1's with my Manager, I let my Manager know of Jason's lack of
progress.

Personally, I'll confide that I was frustrated that my Manager did not take faster action to eliminate Jason from the
team. From my perspective, as a Technical Lead, Jason was getting paid more than I was, yet was not contributing to the
team in any way. As a result, the team's morale was sinking, especially amongst a top performer. However, I kept my
thoughts to myself and never shared my frustration with my Manager. Remember that the Manager has the power to hire and
fire. The Technical Lead has influence, but not the direct authority. Look to Robert Greene's first law of power in his
excellent book, "The 48 Laws of Power," as to why I did not share my thoughts:

> Never outshine the master

Sharing my true thoughts would've put me at odds with my own Manager. Revealing those thoughts would deliver an implicit
criticism: "I know better than you." As a Tech Lead, help the team, but know and respect boundaries of your Manager.
